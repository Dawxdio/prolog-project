# prolog-project

This is a project I made for the Paradigms of Programming course at University. The assignment was to program something using Prolog or Haskell, optionally with an additional language for some extra functionality. 
I decided to make the ancient Chinese game "Go" using Prolog, with Python handling user input.
This program was intended to run in a command line interface, with the user clicking on the terminal window to change the game state.
